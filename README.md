# SELF_PARKING_CAR_USING_ARDUINO
A prototype of a car capable of demonstrating autonomous parallel parking using arrduino uno.
**OVERVIEW**
Parallel parking can be challenging for many drivers. Many modern day cars do
not have any systems in place to make parking a lot easier.And the vehicles that has
autonomous parking facilities are not affordable for common people.So, the purpose of
this project is to design a simple prototype parking system that can perform parallel
parking manoeuvres without much input from the driver . The system can be configured
to be compatible with any commercially available vehicle at an affordable price.The system
works with the help of a series of sensors and is monitored and controlled by an arduino
micro-controller. The system is currently implemented in a scaled down model of a vehicle
but can be implemented with a few modifications onto a real one. This project explores
how sensor inputs, algorithms can be used for practical applications. By further improving
the algorithms the program loaded in the arduino can be updated to include other kinds
of parking like angle parking, perpendicular parking etc.... without changing the system
components.
